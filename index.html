        <P><b>Lamborghini</b> - Manufacturing magnate Italian Ferruccio Lamborghini founded the company in 1963 with the
            objective of producing a refined grand touring car to compete with offerings from established marques such
            as Ferrari. The company's first models, such as the 350 GT, were released in the mid-1960s. Lamborghini was
            noted for the 1966 Miura sports coupé, which used a rear mid-engine, rear-wheel drive layout.

            Lamborghini grew rapidly during its first ten years, but sales fell in the wake of the 1973 worldwide
            financial downturn and the oil crisis. Ferruccio Lamborghini sold the company to Georges-Henri Rossetti and
            René Leimer and retired in 1974. The company went bankrupt in 1978, and was placed in the receivership of
            brothers Jean-Claude and Patrick Mimran in 1980. The Mimrans purchased the company out of receivership by
            1984 and invested heavily in its expansion. Under the Mimrans' management, Lamborghini's model line was
            expanded from the Countach to include the Jalpa sports car and the LM002 high-performance off-road vehicle.

        <p><b>McLaren</b> - Founded in 1963 by New Zealander Bruce McLaren, the team won its first Grand Prix at the
            1968 Belgian Grand Prix, but their greatest initial success was in Can-Am, which they dominated from 1967 to
            1971. Further American triumph followed, with Indianapolis 500 wins in McLaren cars for Mark Donohue in 1972
            and Johnny Rutherford in 1974 and 1976. After Bruce McLaren died in a testing accident in 1970, Teddy Mayer
            took over and led the team to their first Formula One Constructors' Championship in 1974, with Emerson
            Fittipaldi and James Hunt winning the Drivers' Championship in 1974 and 1976 respectively. The year 1974
            also marked the start of a long-standing sponsorship by Phillip Morris' Marlboro cigarette brand.</p>

        <p><b>Ferrari</b> - Ferrari S.p.A. (/fəˈrɑːri/; Italian: [ferˈraːri]) is an Italian luxury sports car
            manufacturer based in Maranello, Italy. Founded by Enzo Ferrari in 1939 out of the Alfa Romeo race division
            as Auto Avio Costruzioni, the company built its first car in 1940, and produced its first Ferrari-badged car
            in 1947.

            Fiat S.p.A. acquired 50% of Ferrari in 1969 and expanded its stake to 90% in 1988.[4] In October 2014, Fiat
            Chrysler Automobiles (FCA) announced its intentions to separate Ferrari S.p.A. from FCA; as of the
            announcement FCA owned 90% of Ferrari.[5][6][7] The separation began in October 2015 with a restructuring
            that established Ferrari N.V. (a company incorporated in the Netherlands) as the new holding company of the
            Ferrari S.p.A. group,[8] and the subsequent sale by FCA of 10% of the shares in an IPO and concurrent
            listing of common shares on the New York Stock Exchange.[9] Through the remaining steps of the separation,
            FCA's interest in Ferrari's business was distributed to shareholders of FCA, with 10% continuing to be owned
            by Piero Ferrari.[10] The spin-off was completed on 3 January 2016.[9]</p>
